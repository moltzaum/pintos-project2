### README for Project 1: Threads

#### Design Document

The design document can be found in *DOC_P1.md* in the same 
folder as this _README_

#### Group Participants
 
Matthew Moltzau <matthew.moltzau@ucdenver.edu>  
Michael Hedrick <michael.hedrick@ucdenver.edu>

#### Common Commands to Run

##### Compiling the Kernel Manually
> cd $PINTOS_ROOT/src/threads  
> make

##### Running a Single Test 
> pintos -v -- run *test_name*  

##### Running the Testing Script  
The script will run tests as they appear in the script 
internally. We have two separate scripts 1) The original
_and_ 2) The one accessible from any place in the commandline
provided src/utils is in $PATH. This version may also accept 
"debug" as an argument, which passes --gdb when running the pintos kernel.
> p1-thread-tests

_OR_
> cd $PINTOS_ROOT/src/threads  
> bash pintos-p1-tests.sh

#### _TODO_

_Alarm:_  
The alram may need to be updated. See details in the design doc.

*DOC_P1:*  
There are just a couple loose strings in the design doc.

### Project 2: User Programs

#### Group Participants
Michael Hedrick  
Matthew Moltzau  

#### Working Directory and Pintos Utilities
We will be working primarily from `src/userprog`, which is where the kernel is
located. You can invoke "make" just like normal.

For testing, run `pintos-p2-tests` (kudos to Brian). The bash script is located
in `src/userprog`, but an alias exists in `src/utils` so that you can call it
from anywhere.

A bash script `pintos-run-util` was just created that helps with loading and
running user programs. It can run tests, but is limited since it can't pass
the correct arguments to right tests just yet.

The grader will be using `make check` from the build directory.

#### Pintos Project 2 Assignments
Argument Passing  
Handling User Memory   
System Call Infrastructure  
File Operations (using fd)  

#### Design Considerations
See `DOC_P2.md` for the design document.
