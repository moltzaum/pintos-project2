TODO: Populate this readme.
This should hold a good amount of documentation with
the current goal of the project, how to compile, etc;.

According to Ivo, the readme should specifically contain:
  (1) Our own notes, written out so others can understand it.
  (2) A guide to our project design and implementation.

Appendix D is an example of project documentation that we
should follow.
